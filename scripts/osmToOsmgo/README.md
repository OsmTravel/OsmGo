# OsmToOsmGo

Convert the XML of OSM to a geojson specially for Osm Go!.

No more Dom Parser! It use _fast-xml-parser_ and can be used in a webworker !

It's like  _osmtogeojson.js_ but faster and more readable.


It had usefull properties to the geojson features like :
 - _usedByWays_ : if a node is used by a way
 - _ndRef_ : The nodes that compose the ways
 - time : the timestam in ms
 - fixme : if he had a fixme tag

It can filter output data with the osmGo tagconfig and get the "primary key" & generate the icon name

It can merge the new data with the old geojson data (and bbox)
