## iD presets

Some translations are from iD presets. For iD preset translation see [their documentation](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#translating).

## TagInfo descriptions

Some translations are extracted from TagInfo like the element "descriptions". See the column "description" in TagInfo for a bench: https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/bench#wiki

TagInfo get those descriptions from OSM wiki. Make sure to add the "| description = " in the infobox of the related article in the wiki. Example for bench: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key%3Abench Note you can also press the "pencil" icon in the description field of the infobox. It will redirect you to the corresponding wiki Item. Example for bench: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Item:Q88
